# LoLdle answers

Fetch and decrypt answers for [LoLdle.net](https://loldle.net/) quiz. Both EU and US regions are supported.

## Sidenote(s)

Hiding encryption keys in JavaScript files is not a good idea.

[CryptoJS](https://github.com/brix/crypto-js) sucks, I have no idea why LoLdle creator used it.
